# Qiskit-Global-Summer-School-2023-Theory-to-Implementation
The Qiskit Global Summer School 2023 was a two-week intensive summer program designed to empower the quantum researchers and developers of tomorrow with the know-how to explore the world of quantum computing, as well as refresh and sharpen industry professional skills. This fourth-annual summer school focused foundationally on quantum computing by taking a back-to-basics approach, with a look at making the transition from theory to implementation.

I have solved these labs and have uploaded them here to showcase my quantum computing expertise using Qiskit. 
Fortunately, All the lectures are available on YouTube and the Qiskit website.
